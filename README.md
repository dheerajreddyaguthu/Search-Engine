# Search-Engine

Problem Statement: 
You are required to implement a search engine for unt.edu.
1. Implement vector space retrieval model for the search
2. Evaluation of the system:
1. Select a word of your choice
2. Run the query on the original unt.edu
3. Run the same query on your system
4. Compare the result and report any discrepancies
3. Please note: You need to crawl the unt.edu to collect webpages in unt.edu and 
parse them to get terms that may end up in your dictionary.
4. You can use any library to crawl and parse web pages or you can use your own 
custom-built crawler/parser.
